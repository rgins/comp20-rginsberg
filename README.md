##COMP 20 Web Programming Labs and Assignments 

*My favorite assignment was mbta because I created a working and useful application. The google maps api is well documented, which made it easier to work with than other apis used in this class.
*Compared to day 1 of this course, I actually understand how the web works. I also have much more experience reading online documentation and figuring out how to connect different pieces to creating a web app with a server side and client side. 
*What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
*The most important thing I learned in this course was to "Never ever trust user input". The ease it takes to redirect a site that trusts user input was shocking, and seriously cemented the practice of never ever trusting user input. Also, the ease of dumping the entire contents of server, which tend to hold private information is another example of a different reason to never ever trust user input.
*I would like to delve deeper into understanding how to make more complex servers.
