Everything in this assignment has been correctly implemented.
I have not collaborated with anyone on this assignment.
I have spent approximately 6 hours on this assignment.

I used the example at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript to implement the Haversine forumla in the find_distance() function to find the distance between the user and the closest T stop that was linked in the assignment.
I also refernced the comp20 examples github for implementing the XMLHTTP requests.
I additionally referenced and modified a lot of examples from the google maps api.
